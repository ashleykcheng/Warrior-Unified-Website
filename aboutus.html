                                                Warrior Unified is a student-run club at Woodbridge High School that promotes inclusion and acceptance through sporting activities. We have been a club at Woodbridge for the past 3 years, and cannot wait for our fourth year of helping to further ‘unify’ our school. By joining this club, you will be participating in activities ranging from yoga to basketball. Due to current circumstances, we will be adapting to an online format through Zoom that will continue to engage all of our club members. We cannot wait for the 2020-2021 school year, and hope to see you at meetings!

                                    Hello! My name is Ashley Cheng and I am a senior. As the President of Warrior Unified, I am so excited for this year’s club activities. I joined Warrior Unified because I want to raise awareness of challenges faced by people with special needs, and I'd like to make a difference in my community.  My brother has autism, and I understand the importance and the positive impact of him having good friends. If you have any questions, please feel free to contact me at ashleykcheng@gmail.com.
